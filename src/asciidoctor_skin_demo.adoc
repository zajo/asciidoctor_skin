== Introduction

This is a simple project that builds on the default https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] `.css` file, appending select customizations at the very end.

It also adds a button to the Table of Contents for dynamic switching between Light and Dark mode, using Javascript.

To see this skin in action with a lot more text, see the documentation for https://zajo.github.io/leaf/[LEAF], a lightweight error-handling library for C++11.

== Customizing the CSS

The first thing I wanted to do after extracting the default Asciidoctor `.css` was change the fonts. This requires a line to be inserted near the very top of the file, in this case:

[source]
----
@import "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anonymous+Pro|Istok+Web|Quicksand|Poiret+One";
----

This imports the four Google fonts used: Anonymous Pro, Istok Web, Quicksand and Poiret One.

Next I proceeded with hacking the CSS itself, but rather than just making random changes throughout the text, I appended all the changes at the very end. This is possible, because anything set in CSS can be overridden by targeting the same class or element later on.

== Dynamic Switching between Dark and Light Mode

This is actually very simple to do with Javascript. Once I created the two `.css` files, link:./zajo-dark.css[`zajo-dark.css`] and link:./zajo-dark.css[`zajo-light.css`], I used the `:stylesheet:` attribute at the top of the `.adoc` file to specify that I want `zajo-dark.css` used by default:

[source]
----
:stylesheet: zajo-dark.css
----

Adding the pass:[<input width="32" height="32" type="image" alt="Skin" src="./skin.png" onclick="this.blur();switch_style();return false;"/>] button to the Table of Contents requires a tricky hack. By default, Asciidoctor will use "Table of Contents" as the default title for the table of contents, but it allows us to customize it:

[source]
----
:toc-title: My Table of Contents
----

I have always thought that this is redundant, and used to turn it off like so:

[source]
----
:toc-title:
----

It occurred to me that I can use `:toc-title:` to inject the HTML I need to put up the button. This can be done like so:

[source]
----
ifndef::backend-pdf[] <1>
:toc-title: pass:[<div style="float:right"><input width="32" height="32" type="image" alt="Skin" src="./skin.png" onclick="this.blur();switch_style();return false;"/></div>]
endif::[] <2>
----

<1> We use `ifndef` in order to prevent the HTML being injected when Asciidoctor is producing a PDF.

<2> `pass` will pass everything between the `[` and `]` and inject it directly in the generated HTML output. We have a floating `div`, and a simple script that calls the `switch_style` function (see below).

== Using `docinfo.html` to Inject Javascript

In Asciidoctor it is very easy to add anything to the HEAD section of the generated HTML file. All you have to do is create a file called `docinfo.html`. In this case, the contents of this file is as follows:

[source]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./zajo-light.css" disabled=true> <1>
<script>
function switch_style() <2>
{
	var i, tag;
	for( i=0, tag=document.getElementsByTagName("link"); i<tag.length; i++ )
		if( tag[i].rel.indexOf("stylesheet")!=-1 && tag[i].href.includes("zajo-") ) <3>
			tag[i].disabled = !tag[i].disabled; <4>
}
</script>
----

<1> Add the `zajo-light.css` as a link. Note the `disabled=true`, this ensures that the `zajo-dark.css` will be used by default (it is introduced by the `:stylesheet:` attribute, see above).

<2> This is the Javascript function invoked by the injected button (see the previous section).

<3> Enumerate all CSS links in the HTML file, and if we see one with a name that starts with `zajo-`...

<4> ...toggle its `disabled` state.

== Building

I've included a simple Makefile to generate the HTML using Asciidoctor and to copy the necessary files in the `out` directory (which then can be published). Of course, you must have `asciidoctor` installed on your system.

== That's All!
